### Notes on the Deeper Past
* Between 2008 and 2010, I appear as primary author once, and as co-author three more times from research I did with Dr A. McGovern and my colleagues at the IDEA Lab. This work highlights using Support Vector Machines, and contributing to the development of Spatiotemporal Relational Probability Trees.
