### For More Background on My Work

See my [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-collier-aa70167/). (If you just came [here](https://github.com/mcStargazer/AI-ML-and-DS/blob/main/README.md) from [there](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-collier-aa70167/), be wary of a potential infinite loop. Don't get caught!)

### Recent Practical Projects
* [_**LLM Fine Tuning for Cybersecurity**_](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OFP94l0Btxma-NqYthc5_Jv1f5UQx1s3?usp=sharing) - A demonstration with a cybersecurity dataset derived from NIST's National Vulnerability Database.
* [_**Flood Prediction**_](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DMYd0Bffts5P7kARmYJKKCzqpQaDDYGe?usp=sharing) - A machine learning project highlighting regression. Inspired by one of Kaggle's monthly competitions.
* (in progress) _**Feature Selection**_ - A project highlighting ways to reduce dimensionality in a feature dataset. Eventually, will perform classification to detect manufacturing anomalies in the well-known [semiconductor dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paresh2047/uci-semcom).
* (TBD) a deep learning project to showcase TensorFlow.

### Notes on the Deeper Past
* Between 2008 and 2010, I appear as primary author once, and as co-author three more times from research I did with Dr Amy McGovern and my colleagues at the [IDEA Lab](https://www.mcgovern-fagg.org/idea/). This work highlights using Support Vector Machines, and contributing to the development of Spatiotemporal Relational Probability Trees. You can find the citations by searching on "Collier" at Dr McGovern's [publications webpage](https://mcgovern-fagg.org/amy/publications/). Citations also appear below for convenience:
